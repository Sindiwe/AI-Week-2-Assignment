# Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project uses supervised machine learning to predict the risk of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It aligns with **UN SDG 3 â€“ Good Health and Well-being** by promoting early diagnosis through AI.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Pima Indians Diabetes Database)
- Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, BMI, Age, etc.
- Target: Diabetes Outcome (1 = Positive, 0 = Negative)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model
- Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- StandardScaler for feature scaling
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix

## Ethical Reflection
Bias can arise from underrepresented groups in the data. Our model aims to support, not replace, medical professionals in early diabetes risk detection.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo
2. Ensure `diabetes.csv` is in your directory
3. Open and run `diabetes_prediction_notebook.ipynb`
